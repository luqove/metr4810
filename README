Hi, this is the description file for Team 7's METR4810 Contactless Face Mask

The device is modeled after what we've been calling a printer design.
Essentially treating the face masks like paper, moving them from a stack with conveyors and rollers.

The computations and control are designed to be performed on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

Electrical Components:
    28BYJ-28 Stepper Motor and ULN2003 Driver x2
    Micro Servo 9g
    SEN0208 Water Resistant Ultrasonic Sensor
    SFH 309 FA-4/5 Photo transistor
    LEDs (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Infrared)

PIN LAYOUT:
Stepper -> 3, 5, 7, 11, 16, 18, 22, 24
Servo   -> 12
UL Trig -> 8
UL ECHO -> 10

LEDs
Fault   -> 31
Ready   -> 33
User    -> 35
Disp    -> 37
100%    -> 13
75%     -> 15
50%     -> 19
25%     -> 21
Empty   -> 23

IR
75%     -> 36
50%     -> 38
25%     -> 40
Empty   -> 32
Collect -> 26
